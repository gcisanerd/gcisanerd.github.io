        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-1">You taught me how to be present.
Won't say goodbye to you because I know we will be working together very soon.
Needless to say, Squad gave me a brother that I never had, but now I do :D</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2">You have an inspiring story bro. Use it as your strength and to inspire others. I know you will go miles. All the best for your future endeavour.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-3">Yo GC - wish we had more time working together. My biggest regret will be not getting to see your award-winning "best moves". Hopefully, someday soon.
Wish you all the best on your journey ahead!</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4">Undoubtedly, GC is the most humble person I know. Even when we met for the first time at Squad, he still addresses me as "sir" since we are from the same college :p.
Unfortunately, we never got to work together but it has always been fun to interact with GC. I wish him tons of happiness and all the best for the future.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-5">Humble, great dancer, always ready to help, AMAZING at work, true, innovative -- are merely a few words to describe how Gaurav has been in the past couple of years! Would truly miss having you around!</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-6">I know a very few people who are as passionate and hungry to grow as you GC. Apart from being an inspiring colleague, you have been such a good friend to joke around with too! Keep rocking wherever you go next and stay in touch!</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-7">Seeing you grow was an absolute delight bro. Couldn't have asked for any more dedication. Be confident, be brave and crush it out there!
And ofcourse stay in touch! ❤️</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-8">You will be missed at every weather check in as who is going to start now. You added a different vibe to each work call and made it completely informal. You were always fun to talk to. I still want to know why you always wanted to have everyone's videos on. I wish I would've worked more with you. Wishing you a great future ahead bro!</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-9">You'll be always be remembered for 2 things for me -
a) Crazy dance parties :D.
b) Your transition from "Bulla ki jaana me kaun" to "Sinbad The Sailor" has been exemplary. Rock on!</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-10">"Life is a climb, but the view is great.."
We hardly got to talk, but you have always inspired me alot. Wish you an amazing time ahead. Keep in touch bro!
#new_beginnings</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-11">Gaurav was the first friend I made in squad. I've learned great deal from him. I don't have words to express how sad I am to see you go and how happy I am to see you grow. All the best for your future endeavours bro. Will miss you and seeing your stupid face in the standups :P&lt;3</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-12">We haven't had much chance to work together since you went to backend as soon as i joined insights but i am sure you will kill it wherever you go!
I will always remember our Goa trip and talking with you about our personal lives at Purple Martini. It was nice to know someone with similar struggles in life. I hope that we both not let our past bog down our future and happiness.
Always be in touch bro! I will miss you :(
I will be sure to visit your cafe wherever you decide to open it :P</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-13">Whenever I had word with you, it always felt like I am talking to my elder brother. I really love the way you explain things. The growth you have made as a developer is so inspiring which each and every developer will look towards.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-14">Sadly I didn't get to work with GC directly but I think we did have a lot of fun while working giving that we did so on the same table in the hall. That along with TT games with him will be how I remember him here at SquadStack. All the best GC and do keep in touch regardless of where your journey takes you!
P.S. Thank you for suggesting Dead Poets Society to me :)</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-15">Yo Gaurav! (It feels weird to say your actual name :P)
I'm so glad that we got to work together while building the Webapp - It was super fun! Along with being a pro at work, you are also an amazing friend. Culture is one of the best things about this company, and for me, you're among those people who have made me believe that 'you can have fun at work + meet awesome people' - thank you for this! &lt;3
Believe it or not, I do regret not coming to Goa :see_no_evil:
Milte rehna GC!</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-16">There aren't enough words to describe your bro, you are truly an inspiration in every aspect of life, be it professional or personal, i always felt you are more like a big bro to me and seeing you go will be really sad :( .
I have learnt a lot from you and enjoyed the time we had in goa. In the end all i can say is tussi na jao, but still wishing you all the best for your new job and your career.</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-17">Sad to see you go but wishing you happiness as you begin a new chapter in your life. Wishing you all the best in the next step of your career!</p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-18">It was fun to meet you in person
best of luck for your future</p>
